## <a name="P_Airl"></a> A Novel Airlift Photobioreactor for Microalgae Cultivation
### __Goals__
- To study the effects of hydrodynamics and culture conditions on microalgae: 
    - growth
    - biomass production
    - gas holdup 

    in an airlift photobioreactor.

### __Tasks / Outcomes__ 
- Designed and executed experiments to assess the effect of microalgae culture conditions – nitrate and CO2 concentrations, light/dark cycles, and temperature – and flow rate on growth rate, lipid content, and carbon capture of local *Synechococcus elongatus*.
- Effectively gathered, evaluated, and visualized data across various projects and showcased findings at national conferences.

## <a name="P_CCSyn"></a> Evaluating the Effect of Culture Conditions on Biodiesel Production and Carbon Capture of Native Synechococcus elongatus Microalgae
### __Goals__
- To maximize the *growth rate* and *lipid content* of local *Synechococcus elongatus* by optimizing the culture medium t(isolated from local hot springs in *Ramsar*). 
### __Tasks / Outcomes__ 
- Investigated the effect of various nitrate concentrations, temperature, and light/dark cycles on growth rate and lipid content of microalgae. We used soxhlet method for lipid extraction.

## <a name="P_CoBioDG"></a> Investigating the co-production of biodiesel and biogas from microalgae
### __Goals__
- To identify a cost-effective method for biodiesel and biogas production from microalgae (B.Sc. thesis). 
### __Tasks / Outcomes__ 
- Identified suitable microalgae strains for the algae culture studies – *Botryococcus braunii (lb572 & UTEX-2441)* 
- Compared various cultivation systems, and microalgae lipid extraction methods. 
- Designed an integrated biodiesel & biogas production system.
