## <a name="P_TEA"></a> Techno-economic Assessment of Bioenergy & Fertilizer Production from Brewery & Food Waste via Anaerobic Digestion
### __Goals__
- To design & build an Anaerobic Digestion (AD) plant that converts bio-wastes from the [Jackie’Os Pub & Brewery](https://jackieos.com/) into bioenergy and fertilizer 
- Evaluate the economic viability under various operational scenarios

### __Tasks / Outcomes__ 
- Designed and modeled an AD system for the [Jackie’Os Pub & Brewery](https://jackieos.com/) (Funded by the **Environmental Protection Agency**).

- Performed techno-economic analysis and environmental impact assessment for various operation scenarios to identify the optimum mode of operation (work in progress).
